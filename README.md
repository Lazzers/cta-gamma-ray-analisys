1. Run `adaptest.py`
2. Keep focus on displayed images
3. You can change:
	
	- **niter**, Number of iterations of gaussian + median filter: use `g` to increase and `f` to decrease
	- **blockSize**, Size of a pixel neighbourhood that is used to calculate a threshold value for the pixel in adaptive threshold:  use `up-arrow` to increase and `down-arrow` to decrease
	- **const**, Constant subtracted from the mean or weighted mean in adaptive threshold: use `right-arrow` to increase and `left-arrow` to decrease
